Conclusão entre experiencia 1 e 2:

-Performance:
Experiment 2 (more members in Group B) provides better overall performance. 
It has higher accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, as well as a better ROC AUC (0.9401),
suggesting that the model can better distinguish between groups when Group B is larger.
-Fairness:
Both experiments show similar levels of fairness, with Equal Opportunity Differences of 0.958 and 0.964 respectively. 
The model’s fairness metrics indicate that it is fairly balanced, 
though still slightly biased in favor of the majority group in each scenario.
-Impact of Group Size:
Larger Group A: Slightly worse precision and fairness metrics, potentially because the model has more data from Group A and may overfit slightly to it.
Larger Group B: Results in better performance across the board and a slight increase in bias toward Group B,
but the model shows improved precision and recall, suggesting that a more balanced or larger Group B provides more reliable classification overall.

Conclusão entre experiencias 3 e 4:
 
-Impact of Unequal Wealth Growth Rates:
The unequal wealth growth rates (0.6 for Group A and 0.2 for Group B) lead to significant fairness challenges
in both experiments. Even though performance is good, there is a clear bias toward Group A,
which is reflected in the Equal Opportunity Difference.
The wealth advantage of Group A is likely causing the model to overestimate the chances of Group A 
achieving positive outcomes, hence the relatively high false positive rate when compared to Group B, 
particularly in Experiment 3.

-Effect of Group Size:
In Experiment 4, increasing the number of Group B members (200 Group B vs 100 Group A) leads to improved overall performance
(higher accuracy, precision, and F1-score). This suggests that more data from Group B helps the model better understand
the differences between the two groups, resulting in fewer misclassifications.
In Experiment 3, where Group A is larger, the model struggles more with precision, 
likely due to the wealth advantage of Group A skewing the predictions.

-Fairness Trade-offs:
In both experiments, the fairness metrics (specifically the Equal Opportunity Difference) show that
wealth accumulation disparity creates a notable bias. Despite having more Group B members in Experiment 4, 
the model remains biased toward Group A due to their higher wealth growth rate.

Conclusions:
-Performance: Experiment 4 (more Group B members) delivers better overall performance,
as evidenced by the higher precision, F1-score, and ROC AUC. However, this does not significantly
reduce the bias caused by unequal wealth accumulation.
-Fairness: Both experiments suffer from fairness issues due to the wealth growth rate inequality.
Even though Experiment 4 performs better, the model remains biased toward Group A,
as reflected by the high Equal Opportunity Difference.

Final Conclusions (all 4 experiences)

From all four experiments, it is clear that while balancing group sizes improves model performance,
unequal wealth growth rates lead to systematic bias toward Group A. 
Therefore, addressing wealth accumulation disparities is essential for reducing bias and improving fairness in the model.
The experiments highlight the need for fairness interventions.
Simply adjusting the size of the groups does not fully solve the fairness issue. 
The unequal wealth growth rate creates structural bias, which affects the model's predictions.
Mitigating these biases will likely require changing the simulation parameters 
(e.g., reducing wealth accumulation disparities) or applying fairness-aware techniques
(such as using fairness constraints during model training).
